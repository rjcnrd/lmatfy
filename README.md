# NeoChat | Fullstack Application

[Link to the project](http://www.neochat.co/)

Neochat is a real time messaging app that allows you to chat with your friends in a fun and casual way: by adding a gif to each message you send. I created Neochat during a 9 week bootcamp in javascript @Ironhack and worked 8 days on the creation of the app. 

### Stack

Neochat is a fullstack application using the MERN stack. The project uses the giphy API to search for matching gifs.
